# Pull Request: Initial Vulnerability Discovery Module Implementation

## Changes

### 1. Core Components
- Implemented base vulnerability scanner interface
- Created comprehensive data models for vulnerabilities and payloads
- Integrated Nuclei scanner with custom template generation
- Added vulnerability manager for coordinating scans

### 2. Features Implemented
- Basic vulnerability scanning with Nuclei integration ✅
- Custom payload testing support ✅
- Configurable scan settings and rate limiting ✅
- Result verification and false positive handling ✅
- Real-time scan status tracking ✅
- Extensible scanner registration system ✅

### 3. Models and Types
- Added `VulnResult` for vulnerability findings
- Added `PayloadResult` for payload testing results
- Created `ScanConfig` for configurable scans
- Added enums for severity and payload types
- Added type hints and validation

### 4. Scanner Implementation
- Abstract base scanner interface
- Nuclei scanner integration with:
  - Custom template generation
  - Real-time result parsing
  - Rate limiting
  - Clean resource management
  - Payload verification

### 5. Example Usage
- Added example script demonstrating:
  - Full vulnerability scan
  - Custom payload testing
  - Scan status monitoring
  - Result analysis

## Next Steps (Phase 4 Continuation)

1. **Additional Scanner Integrations**
   - [ ] Implement OWASP ZAP integration
   - [ ] Add wfuzz for fuzzing capabilities
   - [ ] Add custom fuzzing engine

2. **AI Integration**
   - [ ] Add payload generation using LLMs
   - [ ] Implement false positive reduction using ML
   - [ ] Add vulnerability description and remediation generation

3. **Additional Features**
   - [ ] Add payload effectiveness tracking
   - [ ] Implement historical scan comparison
   - [ ] Add export capabilities for findings
