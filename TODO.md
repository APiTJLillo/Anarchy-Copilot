## Phase 1: Project Setup & Architecture

1. **Define Project Vision & Scope**
   - Write a concise project description, goals, and target audience.
   - Clarify which types of targets (web, network, APIs) will be supported in the initial release.
   - Ensure alignment with ethical, legal, and bug bounty best practices.

2. **Repository & License Setup** (Completed)
   - Create the GitHub repository.
   - Choose and apply an open-source license (e.g., MIT, GPLv3, Apache) that aligns with your monetization strategy.

3. **Technology Stack Decisions** (In Progress)
   - Confirm **Python** as the primary language for core/AI logic. (Confirmed)
   - Choose a backend framework (e.g., Django or FastAPI). (FastAPI chosen)
   - Decide on the front-end approach: (Pure web app with React chosen)
     - **Pure web app** (using frameworks like React/Vue/Angular) **or**
     - **Hybrid desktop app** with Electron or Tauri.
   - Outline future plans to integrate Rust/Go modules for performance-critical tasks.

4. **High-Level Architecture & Project Structure**
   - Plan the folder structure (e.g., `core`, `ai_module`, `recon_module`, `plugins`, `frontend`, etc.).
   - Determine how modules (Recon, Scan, Exploit, Reporting, AI) will communicate (e.g., function calls, microservices, internal APIs).
   - Define the plugin interface strategy (initially via a dedicated Python plugin directory).

5. **Initial Project Boilerplate** (Completed)
   - Initialize the Python backend with the chosen framework.
   - Set up package managers (`requirements.txt`, Poetry, or Pipenv).
   - Configure logging, environment variable handling, and config files.
   - Integrate a lightweight database (SQLite/PostgreSQL) for storing findings and user data.
   - Implement a simple “Hello World” route/page to verify end-to-end connectivity.

## Phase 2: Data Model & Core Database

1. **Design Data Schemas**
   - **Projects**: Name, scope details, owners, etc.
   - **Recon Results**: Domains, subdomains, IPs, etc.
   - **Vulnerabilities**: Vulnerability type, severity, status, assigned user, etc.
   - **Reports**: Associated vulnerabilities, final text, timestamps.
   - **User & RBAC**: Structures for multi-user support (if applicable).

2. **Implement ORM Models & Migrations**
   - Create models using your chosen framework.
   - Set up migrations to evolve the schema.
   - Ensure proper relationships (e.g., one project → many vulnerabilities).

3. **Basic CRUD & API Endpoints**
   - Implement endpoints to create, read, update, and delete records (for Projects, Vulnerabilities, Recon data).
   - Integrate basic user authentication (if RBAC is needed from the start).
