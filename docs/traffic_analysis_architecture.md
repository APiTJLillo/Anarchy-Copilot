# Traffic Analysis Engine Architecture

## Overview
The Traffic Analysis Engine will provide comprehensive analysis of proxy traffic to identify security issues, patterns, and anomalies. It will integrate the existing components into a unified system with a consistent API.

## Core Components

### 1. TrafficAnalysisManager
- Central manager for all traffic analysis functionality
- Coordinates between different analysis modules
- Provides unified API for frontend and other components
- Manages analysis configuration and state

### 2. Analysis Modules
- **SecurityAnalyzer**: Enhanced version of existing TrafficAnalyzer
  - Pattern-based detection of security issues
  - Vulnerability scanning
  - Attack vector identification
- **PerformanceAnalyzer**: Integration with existing monitoring modules
  - Trend analysis
  - Anomaly detection
  - Performance metrics tracking
- **BehaviorAnalyzer**: New module for analyzing traffic behavior
  - Session tracking
  - User behavior patterns
  - Sequence analysis
  - Correlation between requests

### 3. Analysis Rules System
- Rule-based engine for defining custom analysis rules
- Support for different rule types (security, performance, behavior)
- Rule priority and conflict resolution
- Rule import/export functionality

### 4. Data Storage and Retrieval
- Efficient storage of analysis results
- Historical data management
- Query interface for retrieving analysis data

### 5. Visualization and Reporting
- Integration with frontend components
- Real-time dashboards
- Detailed reports generation
- Alert system

## Integration Points

### Proxy Integration
- Enhanced RealTimeAnalysisInterceptor
- WebSocket message analysis
- HTTP request/response analysis
- Raw packet analysis

### Frontend Integration
- Analysis results API
- WebSocket-based real-time updates
- Configuration interface
- Visualization components

## Data Flow
1. Traffic captured by proxy interceptors
2. Raw traffic sent to TrafficAnalysisManager
3. Manager distributes to appropriate analysis modules
4. Analysis results stored and made available via API
5. Real-time updates sent to frontend via WebSocket
6. Historical analysis available through query API

## Configuration System
- Global configuration for analysis engine
- Module-specific configuration
- Rule configuration
- User preferences

## Implementation Plan
1. Enhance existing TrafficAnalyzer with more detection capabilities
2. Create TrafficAnalysisManager to coordinate modules
3. Integrate existing monitoring modules
4. Implement BehaviorAnalyzer module
5. Create unified API for frontend access
6. Develop visualization components
7. Implement rule-based system
8. Add reporting and alerting functionality
