# Pull Request: Completed Reconnaissance Module Core Features

## Changes
- Added continuous monitoring and scheduling system with:
  - Configurable scan intervals
  - Automatic change detection between scans
  - JSON-based schedule persistence
  - Rate-limited execution
  - Background task management
- Enhanced package structure with proper type hints
- Added comprehensive documentation
- Fixed import paths and module organization

## Technical Details
### New Components
1. `ReconScheduler` class
   - Manages scheduled reconnaissance tasks
   - Supports interval-based scheduling
   - Handles result comparison and change tracking
   - Provides task persistence

2. `ScanDict` type definition
   - Type-safe handling of scan results
   - Proper typing for different scan types

3. Package Structure
   - Added py.typed markers for PEP 561 compliance
   - Organized imports with proper relative paths
   - Added type stubs for key components

## Testing
- [ ] Add unit tests for scheduler functionality
- [ ] Test change detection with sample data
- [ ] Verify rate limiting works as expected
- [ ] Test scheduler persistence across restarts

## Next Steps: Vulnerability Discovery Module
Will begin work on:
1. Integrating vulnerability scanners (Nuclei, ZAP)
2. Implementing fuzzing capabilities
3. Adding AI-driven payload generation
4. Building false positive reduction system

## Review Checklist
- [ ] Check scheduler logic and race conditions
- [ ] Review rate limiting implementation
- [ ] Verify type hints are correct
- [ ] Test package installation process
- [ ] Review documentation accuracy
