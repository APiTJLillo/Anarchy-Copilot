# Anarchy Copilot

AI-powered bug bounty suite that integrates modern technologies to streamline the bug bounty process. The suite includes a custom web proxy with advanced interception capabilities, along with comprehensive reconnaissance and vulnerability scanning features.

## Features

- **Proxy Client**: A client application that polls for proxy settings and applies them as needed.
- **Local Proxy Checkbox**: A UI checkbox to enable the local proxy, which only activates when the Docker proxy is running.
- **Proxy Settings Endpoint**: A new `/settings` endpoint to provide current proxy settings to the client.

## Installation

```bash
# Development installation
pip install -e ".[dev]"

# Regular installation
pip install .
```

## Docker Development

After making changes to Python dependencies (requirements.txt or setup.py):

```bash
# Rebuild containers with new dependencies
docker compose build dev proxy

# Restart services
docker compose up -d
```

## Development Setup

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/anarchycopilot/anarchycopilot.git
cd anarchycopilot
```

2. Create a virtual environment:

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # Linux/macOS
venv\Scripts\activate     # Windows
```

3. Install development dependencies:

```bash
pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

4. Configure environment variables:

```bash
# Copy example environment file
cp .env.example .env

# Edit .env file with your settings
nano .env  # or use your preferred editor
```

5. Run environment validation:

```bash
python -m tests.tools.validate_environment
```

6. Run tests:

```bash
make test
```

## Environment Configuration

The application uses environment variables for configuration. Default values are provided in `.env.example`. Key configuration areas include:

### API Settings

- `ANARCHY_API_TITLE` - API name in OpenAPI docs
- `ANARCHY_API_VERSION` - API version
- `ANARCHY_DEBUG` - Enable debug mode
- `ANARCHY_CORS_ORIGINS` - Allowed CORS origins

### Proxy Settings

- `ANARCHY_PROXY_HOST` - Proxy server host
- `ANARCHY_PROXY_PORT` - Proxy server port
- `ANARCHY_PROXY_INTERCEPT_REQUESTS` - Enable request interception
- `ANARCHY_PROXY_INTERCEPT_RESPONSES` - Enable response interception
- `ANARCHY_PROXY_MAX_CONNECTIONS` - Maximum concurrent connections

### AI & Language Settings

- `ANARCHY_LLM_MODEL` - Language model selection
- `ANARCHY_LLM_API_KEY` - API key for language model
- `ANARCHY_TRANSLATION_MODEL` - Translation model selection
- `ANARCHY_SEMANTIC_CACHE` - Enable semantic caching
- `ANARCHY_CULTURAL_DB` - Path to cultural context database

### Certificate Settings

- `CA_CERT_PATH` - Path to CA certificate
- `CA_KEY_PATH` - Path to CA private key

### Certificate Management

The proxy requires certificates for HTTPS inspection. Here's how to set up certificates:

1. Generate certificates using the provided script:

```bash
# Generate and install certificates
./scripts/generate_and_trust_certs.sh

# Manual certificate location check
ls -l certs/
```

2. Trust the CA certificate:

- For development, the script automatically adds the CA to the system trust store
- For production, users need to manually trust the CA certificate:
  - Linux/macOS: Import ca.crt into system keychain
  - Windows: Import ca.crt into "Trusted Root Certification Authorities"
  - iOS/Android: Install the CA profile from http://localhost:8000/ca.crt

3. Certificate locations:

- Development: Certificates are stored in `./certs/` directory
- Docker: Mounted at `/app/certs/` in containers
- Default paths:
  ```
  ./certs/ca.crt  # CA certificate
  ./certs/ca.key  # CA private key
  ```

4. Environment configuration:

```bash
# .env file
CA_CERT_PATH=./certs/ca.crt
CA_KEY_PATH=./certs/ca.key
```

⚠️ Security Note: Keep the CA private key secure and never commit it to version control.
