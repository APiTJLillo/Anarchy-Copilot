# Anarchy Copilot

AI-powered bug bounty suite that integrates modern technologies to streamline the bug bounty process. The suite includes a custom web proxy with advanced interception capabilities, along with comprehensive reconnaissance and vulnerability scanning features.

## Features

- **Proxy Client**: A client application that polls for proxy settings and applies them as needed.
- **Local Proxy Checkbox**: A UI checkbox to enable the local proxy, which only activates when the Docker proxy is running.
- **Proxy Settings Endpoint**: A new `/settings` endpoint to provide current proxy settings to the client.


### Reconnaissance Module âœ…
- Automated subdomain discovery
- Port scanning and service detection
- Web endpoint analysis
- Continuous monitoring with change detection
- Scheduling system for recurring scans
- AI-assisted pattern recognition for interesting findings
- Real-time progress tracking

### Vulnerability Discovery Module ðŸ”„
- **Advanced Proxy Platform**:
  - Custom web attack proxy with request/response interception
  - Real-time traffic analysis and pattern matching
  - Session management and replay capabilities
  - HTTP/HTTPS/HTTP2 and WebSocket support
  - Plugin system for custom interceptors
  - Automated security testing workflows

- **Integrated Scanning**:
  - Nuclei integration as primary scanning engine
  - Auxiliary tool integration (SQLMap, XSSHunter, etc.)
  - AI-driven parameter mutation and fuzzing
  - Automated vulnerability verification
  - Advanced false positive reduction with ML
  - JavaScript deobfuscation and analysis

- **Performance & Scale**:
  - Efficient traffic handling and connection pooling
  - Distributed scanning capabilities
  - Advanced resource management
  - Real-time monitoring and alerting
